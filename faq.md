Your ***"eating window"*** is the period of time during the day where you're eating food. Think of it like this &mdash; When you take your first bite of food for the day, your eating window *"opens"*. When you take your last bite of food for the day, your eating window *"closes"*. If you had your first meal at **11:00 AM** and then had another meal at **5:00 PM**, then you had a ***6 hour eating window*** for the day.

With **Window**, you track your eating window. You can open and close it any time you'd like, or schedule it to open and close automatically at certain times of the day.

When you aren't eating, you're ***"fasting"***. Window automatically calculates your *fast duration* as the time between any two eating windows. If you finish your eating window for one day at **5:00 PM** and then open your eating window on the following day at **11:00 AM**, then you fasted for **18 hours**.


{% include section.html name="Why can't my eating window be longer than 20 hours?" %}

Window supports *[eating windows](#what-is-an-eating-window?)* up to 20 hours, and *fasts* up to 7 days.

Your eating window usually won't be longer than 12 hours, though. An eating window of 12 hours would mean that you had your first meal at **8:00 AM** and your last meal at **8:00 PM**. That's a full day of eating &mdash; but everyone's allowed to take days off on occasion! 

Longer eating windows are less common. For example, a 20 hour eating window would mean that you had your first meal at **3:00 AM** and then had your last meal at **11:00 PM**. Most people aren't awake for 20 hours at a time &mdash; and if you're sleeping, you aren't eating!


{% include section.html name="Does Window sync my data between my iPhone and my iPad?" %}

Not yet! At this time, Window doesn't automatically sync your data across your devices (e.g. from your iPhone to your iPad). But I'm working on that feature for a future update! Stay tuned.
