Protecting your private information is a paramount priority for us. This Statement of Privacy applies to the *Window* app and governs data collection and usage. *Window* is a utility app designed to track intermittent fasting windows. By using the *Window* app, you, “the user”, consent to the data practices described in this statement.

## Collection of your Personal Information
We collect and store data essential the the operation of the app, such eating window start times, eating window end times, note text, attached photographs, and logged weight data. This data is not shared with any service and is only accessible through the *Window* app.

The user's weight data is stored using the *Apple Health* app and associated *HealthKit* framework. *Apple Health* and *HealthKit* are services provided by *Apple, Inc.*, and the associated data is this protected according to the *[Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/)*.

On devices where *HealthKit* is unavailable (on iPad, for example), the user may opt-in to storing their weight data using the *Window* app’s standard data storage methods, where it is not shared with any service and is only accessible through the *Window* app.

## Security of your Personal Information
*Window* protects the user’s personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure through systems provided by *Apple*. Data is not transmitted off of the device in which it was created or entered, with the exception of a very limited amount of *anonymous data* as described below.

## Anonymous Data Collection
*Window* collects and transmits some anonymous data related to critical functions of the application. *Window* uses the *Crashlytics* service to transmit anonymous crash reports. User data is not included in these reports. *Window* also uses the *Answers* service to collect and transmit minimal information related to your usage of the app. Specifically, *Window* uses *Answers* to track user sessions (how many times the app is used, and for how long). *Window* doesn’t transmit any information about how you use the app (for example, what features you use), and *Window* doesn’t transmit any of the data created or logged by the user.

*Crashlytics* and *Answers* are services provided by *Google, Inc.*, and the associated data is thus protected according to the *[Google Privacy Policy]((https://policies.google.com/privacy))*.


## Opt-Out & Deletion of Data
*Window* does not retain user data after it has been deleted by the user. Deleting the *Window* app from the iOS device destroys all references to the user and the user’s information.

The user can opt-out of the *Anonymous Data Collection* methods described above from the *Settings* screen of the *Window* app. If the user chooses to opt-out, no data will be transmitted off of the device.

## Changes to this Statement
This Statement of Privacy may be updated occasionally to reflect product evolution and feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement of Privacy to be aware how your information is being used and protected.

## Contact Information
We welcome your questions and comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that *Window* has not adhered to this Statement, please contact the developer at [calstephens.tech](https://calstephens.tech/contact/).

Effective as of November 27, 2018.
