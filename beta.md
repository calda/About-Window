***Window*** is constantly being improved based on user feedback. Join the **Window Beta Program** to test out the latest versions of Window before they're released on the App Store.

## How to Test

The Window Public Beta is available via [TestFlight](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7).  This version of Window includes features and improvements that haven't been released on the App Store yet. This is a **Beta** release, so there may be bugs or other issues with the app at this time.

## Instructions

- Install the **[TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8)** on your iPhone or iPad.
- Open the Test Flight invitation link on your device: **[https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7)**
- Tap the "Start Testing" button. 
- In TestFlight, tap the "Accept" button.
- Tap "Install".
- TestFlight may show you an alert that says *"Do you want to replace the current app version with the test version? You may lose the app's data"*. Dont worry! I've tested this, and upgrading from an old version of Window to the Public Beta of Window **will not** make you lose all of your data. Confirm that you'd like to install the Window beta.
