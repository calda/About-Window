***Window*** is constantly being improved based on user feedback. Join the **Window Beta Program** to test out the latest versions of Window before they're released on the App Store.

## How to Test

The Window Public Beta is available via [TestFlight](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7).  This version of Window includes features and improvements that haven't been released on the App Store yet. This is a **Beta** release, so there may be bugs or other issues with the app at this time.

**Warning:** At this time, if you upgrade to the Window Public Beta and *then* downgrade back to the App Store version of Window, **you will lose all of your data** unless you <a href="#downgrade">make a backup ahead of time</a>. This is because the Window Public Beta uses a new data format that cannot be read by previous versions of Window.

<a class="round-button" href="https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7"><b>Start Testing</b></a> 

Upgrading to the Public Beta should not make the app lose your data (it should migrate over without any issues). But that being said, this is a **beta** release so there may be unexpected issues. It is never a bad idea to make a backup of your eating window data before upgrading to the Window Public Beta. Open the Settings screen in Window, tap **Export Data**, and then save the export somewhere you could retrieve it later. 


## Instructions

- Install the **[TestFlight app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664?mt=8)** on your iPhone or iPad.
- Open the Test Flight invitation link on your device: **[https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7](https://t.co/1uTPl6KFu7)**
- Tap the "Start Testing" button. 
- In TestFlight, tap the "Accept" button.
- Tap "Install".
- TestFlight may show you an alert that says *"Do you want to replace the current app version with the test version? You may lose the app's data"*. Dont worry! I've tested this, and upgrading from an old version of Window to the Public Beta of Window **will not** make you lose all of your data. Confirm that you'd like to install the Window beta.

## <a name="downgrade">How do I downgrade back to the App Store version of Window?</a>

The Beta version of Window uses a new data format that cannot be read by previous versions of Window. If you downgrade back to the App Store version of Window, **you will lose all of your data** unless you make a backup ahead of time. 

- In the Beta version of Window, open the Settings screen and tap **Export Data**.
- Tap **Save to Files** and save the data export in your iCloud Drive.
- Now that you've backed-up your data, it's safe to downgrade back to the App Store version of Window. You can download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/window-fasting-tracker/id1112765909?mt=8).
- Open the App Store version of Window.
- Open the Settings screen and tap **Import Data**.
- Select the *Window Data Export* file from your iCloud Drive.
